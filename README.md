The business idea is to create a platform that not only provides information about people and their hobbies but also offers a matchmaking service. Users can input their hobbies and interests, and the platform can connect them with like-minded individuals or groups in their local area. This would add a social networking element to the service and encourage people to explore new hobbies together, fostering real-world connections.
